Outline
======
The course is intended as a first course in design and analysis of algorithms. The focus is on developing an understanding of the major algorithm design techniques. Algorithmic techniques covered include divide and conquer, greedy, and dynamic programming. Other topics include network flow, NP- completeness, and an introduction to approximation algorithms, and linear programming. At times, the practical side of algorithm design and implementation is also explored with examples of their usage in solving industry problems.
