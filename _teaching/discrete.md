Outline
======
Discrete Mathematics is the exploration of mathematical structures that are inherently distinct and separate, as opposed to continuous. This course introduces students to foundational concepts and techniques in discrete mathematics, which are vital for various domains of computer science, mathematics, and engineering. The course will cover topics such as Boolean algebra, propositional logic, sets and set operations, proof techniques, graph theory, and complexity analysis.
