Outline
======
This course is intended as a first graduate course in the design and analysis of algorithms. The focus is on developing an understanding for the major algorithm design techniques. Algorithmic techniques covered include divide and conquer, greedy, and dynamic programming. Other topics also include network flow, NP-completeness, approximation algorithms, and linear programming. At times, the practical side of algorithm design and implementation is also explored with interesting examples of their usage in solving industry problems.
