I recently defended my Ph.D. in Computer Science at the **University of Southern California**, where I am a fortunate member of the [Data Science Lab](https://dslab.usc.edu/) led by [Prof. Viktor Prasanna](https://sites.usc.edu/prasanna/). My research is foucs on Graph Representation Learning, specifically applying Graph Neural Network to heterogeneous data from real-world applications. My work is built on a strong quantitative foundation from my Bachelor of Science in Mathematics at **National Taiwan University**.

Previously, I was a researcher assistant at the [Medical Data Analytics (MeDA) Lab](https://www.medalab.ai/) led by [Prof. Weichung Wang](https://www.wwang.info/) at the [National Center for Theoretical Sciences](https://ncts.ntu.edu.tw/). I developed machine learning models for medical imaging, collaboarted with the [National Taiwan University Hospital](https://www.ntuh.gov.tw/) on prostate cancer histopathology image classification as a key component of precision medicine.

Outside of academia, I am a passionate baseball enthusiast dedicated to the field of [sabermetrics](https://sabr.org/sabermetrics/). To bridge the gap between advanced analytics and public discourse, I serve as a technical consultant for the popular Mandarin YouTube channel [Beer C5Â°](https://www.youtube.com/@beerc5tw). I provide data-driven analysis on all facets of the MLB, including player performance, front office strategy, and on-field tactics, making complex topics accessible to a wide audience.
