I was honored to be invited to **Fantasy Baseball 101**, a well-known fantasy baseball podcast in Taiwan. You can listen to the episode here: [EP23 好友盟衛冕冠軍來啦 feat. 星光小菇](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/ep23-%E5%A5%BD%E5%8F%8B%E7%9B%9F%E8%A1%9B%E5%86%95%E5%86%A0%E8%BB%8D%E4%BE%86%E5%95%A6-feat-%E6%98%9F%E5%85%89%E5%B0%8F%E8%8F%87/id1617654765?i=1000581629050).

In this post, I summarize the key strategies I shared on the show that led me to successfully defend my title in our deep, 16-team Fantasy Baseball points league. My journey this year was grueling—I competed in five leagues and made the playoffs in all of them—but this particular league required a unique blend of calculated aggression and strategic flexibility, especially given its strict scoring system.

## Part I: My Draft Philosophy—Aggressive Balance

My overarching strategy was to pursue a balanced roster, avoiding extreme leans toward pitching or hitting. Drafting from the last position (16th overall), I immediately leveraged my back-to-back selections to secure the best available pitcher and hitter to anchor my team.

### 1. Gambling on High-Upside Pitchers

In the early rounds, I prioritized middle infielders (MI). Crucially, I decided to gamble on starting pitchers (SPs) with high "upside"—often those with age or injury concerns, provided their underlying metrics looked solid late in the previous season. I admit my drafting style this year was "a bit too aggressive" compared to my usual conservative approach.

*   **My Riskiest Bets**:
    *   **Round 2 (Pick 17)**: I selected **Jacob deGrom** (Mets, Round 2, Pick 17). I consider him the "strongest pitcher on Earth" when healthy. Unfortunately, he was immediately sidelined for over three months, leaving me with zero roster flexibility. Fortunately, his dominant comeback after the All-Star break helped propel me into the playoffs.
    *   **First-Round Bust**: My 1st-round pick, **Ozzie Albies** (Braves, Round 1, Pick 16), was a complete bust, struggling at the plate, getting injured, and then suffering a setback.

### 2. Power Over Plate Discipline (High-K Hitters)

Despite our scoring system severely penalizing strikeouts, my lineup featured hitters known for aggressive swings and high strikeout rates, such as **Julio Rodríguez** (Mariners, Round 14, Pick 209) and **Willy Adames** (Brewers, Round 11, Pick 176).

*   **The Rationale**: I reasoned that as long as a hitter’s K-rate stayed around 25% (and not approaching the 35% danger zone like **Joey Gallo** (Yankees)), their elite power and overall production would still generate high point totals. Furthermore, for middle infielders like Adames (whose K-rate hovered near 30%), their defensive contributions (assists/errors) could help offset the points lost to strikeouts.

### 3. Securing the Bullpen Early

I place a high premium on consistent relief pitching (RP) due to the substantial bonuses provided for Saves (SV) and Holds. I ensured stability by drafting three elite closers relatively early: **Kenley Jansen** (Braves, Round 10, Pick 145), **Jordan Romano** (Blue Jays, Round 13, Pick 208), and **Taylor Rogers** (Padres, Round 15, Pick 240).

## Part II: In-Season Roster Management

My season began with a significant hurdle: both my IL slots were immediately occupied by **Jacob deGrom** and **Lance Lynn** (White Sox, Round 4, Pick 49). My ability to win early matchups was largely sustained by the strength of my bullpen.

### 1. Aggressive Waiver Wire Acquisitions

I had to be aggressive on the waiver wire to fill roster gaps and hunt for upside.

*   **Kyle Wright** (Braves, Added Apr 11 for $3): I picked him up early in the season. After watching his first start, I felt he was completely transformed, showcasing significantly improved stuff. This quickly became a massive, season-defining acquisition.
*   **Nick Lodolo** (Reds, Added Apr 18 for $2): I acquired him despite a lackluster debut, trusting his high "stuff" rating. He maintained an unexpectedly high strikeout rate throughout the season, becoming a key contributor.
*   **Injury Management**: Holding onto these high-upside players required sacrifice. With only two IL slots, I had to use a Bench (BN) slot to "babysit" injured players alongside deGrom and Lynn, effectively playing with a shorter bench.

### 2. Position Control and Pitching Maximization

Faced with a roster crunch, I employed a tactic of "position control". Noticing that Third Base (3B) was scarce on the waiver wire, I decided to leave the position intentionally empty for a significant portion of the season.

*   **Compensation**: This "stealing from the east to patch up the west" approach allowed me to reallocate those roster slots to pitching. I ensured I had six full relief slots and up to eight starting pitcher slots active, using the stable, high scores generated by my pitching staff to compensate for the missing offensive production at 3B.

### 3. The Championship Bullpen Boost

I believe the bullpen is the easiest place to find value on the waiver wire, and this philosophy paid off massively in the playoffs. I reinforced my RP staff late in the season by acquiring three key relievers:

*   **James Karinchak** (Guardians, Added Aug 8 for $4)
*   **Seranthony Domínguez** (Phillies, Added Jun 13 for $1)
*   **José Alvarado** (Phillies, Added Aug 29 via Waiver)

These late-season acquisitions were crucial for consistent point accumulation during the playoff run. My strategy is to not fill all six RP slots in the draft, saving budget and roster spots for impactful waiver wire pickups like these down the stretch.

### 4. The Unlucky Max Meyer Bet

I was willing to spend significant bidding budget on high-rated rookie pitchers, acquiring **Max Meyer** (Marlins) on Jul 21 for $16. I rated him perhaps second only to **George Kirby** (Mariners). Unfortunately, Meyer was injured after just one start and required Tommy John surgery—a reminder of the inherent risks in this strategy.

## Conclusion: A Strategy Built on Aggressive Investment

My championship success stemmed from an acceptance of high volatility and a relentless focus on maximizing pitching volume and stability.

My strategy mirrors that of an investor who seeks balance but is also willing to invest heavily in promising, volatile startups (high-upside SPs and high-strikeout hitters). By being flexible with my roster configuration (even leaving 3B empty) and redirecting resources into the most dependable scoring assets (pitchers and closers), I maintained a competitive edge even while carrying multiple injured stars.
