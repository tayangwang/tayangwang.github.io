I was thrilled to be invited back to **Fantasy Baseball 101**, the premier fantasy baseball podcast in Taiwan. You can listen to the episode here: [EP73 會員Live Podcast: Fantasy Baseball 年度球隊/DDIP/Sandy](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/ep73-%E6%9C%83%E5%93%A1live-podcast-fantasy-baseball-%E5%B9%B4%E5%BA%A6%E7%90%83%E9%9A%8A-ddip-sandy/id1617654765?i=1000672988024&l=es-MX).

In this episode, I shared the core philosophies that defined my 2024 season in our 16-team Fantasy Baseball head-to-head points league. Here is a summary of the key takeaways:

## 1. Fear No Slump: Betting on Bounce-Back Stars

My first core principle is trusting the mean reversion of elite hitters, especially those coming off a "down" year. A prime example from this season was my selection of **José Ramírez** (Guardians, Round 1, Pick 8) and **Vladimir Guerrero Jr.** (Blue Jays, Round 3, Pick 40). Both players saw their draft stock slip due to slightly underwhelming stats the previous season.

However, I didn't just look at the surface numbers. A deep dive into their Statcast data revealed that their core contact quality and expected statistics remained elite. They hadn't declined; they were just unlucky. This trust in underlying data allowed me to draft first-round talents in the second or third rounds, perfectly executing a "buy low, sell high" value investment strategy.

## 2. Catchers Are Not Disposable: Crushing the Competition

In the Fantasy Baseball community, "punting" the catcher position (waiting until the last rounds to draft one) is a common strategy. I strongly disagree. My early selection of **William Contreras** (Brewers) in the 5th round of another league stands as proof.

The logic is simple: Contreras outscored the next tier of catchers by a massive 40 to 50 points over the season. In weekly matchups, this translates to a consistent, significant advantage at that position—a "head start" that accumulates into an insurmountable lead. While spending a high pick on a catcher carries risk (is it an overpay?), my season proved that this contrarian, high-risk approach can yield high rewards.

That said, I do recognize a middle ground. If the absolute top-tier catchers are off the board, it is perfectly valid to wait until the final rounds or punt the position entirely. However, if a high-quality catcher falls into the **5th to 7th rounds**, they remain a worthy investment to secure that positional edge. I successfully applied this strategy three years ago by drafting **Will Smith** (Dodgers) in the 7th round, which provided a similar competitive advantage.

## 3. Mining for Aces in the Rubble: Finding Gems Late and on the Wire

Who says you need to spend a top-3 pick to get an ace? My pitching staff demonstrated how to build a dominant rotation using late-round picks and savvy free agency moves.

*   **Michael King** (Padres, Round 8, Pick 121): While others questioned his durability as a starter, I focused on his deep arsenal and elite strikeout ability. I grabbed him to shore up my rotation, and he successfully filled the void left by other pitching injuries.
*   **Tanner Houck** (Red Sox, Round 24, Pick 377): My final pick of the draft. This was a bet on pure potential. I believed in his strong finish the previous year and his raw talent. This investment paid off spectacularly, returning ace-level value comparable to pitchers taken in the early rounds.

These examples prove that a dominant pitching staff can be assembled through precision and market insight, allowing you to spend your precious early picks on scarce elite hitters.

## 4. Aggressive FA Bids on High-Ceiling Rookies

I am willing to spend a significant portion of my FAAB budget on high-potential rookies. My acquisitions of **Jared Jones** (Pirates, Added Apr 1 for $35) and **James Wood** (Nationals, Added Jul 8 for $71) illustrate this philosophy.

Although Jones eventually succumbed to injury and Wood required an adjustment period before finding his groove, these investments were absolutely worth it. I also found value on the cheaper end with **Spencer Schwellenbach** (Braves, Added Jun 3 for $2), who proved to be a massive bargain. In a deep league, elite talent is scarce. Betting on the "ceiling" of top prospects is one of the few ways to acquire difference-makers mid-season. Even if they don't hit immediately, the potential payoff justifies the cost.

## 5. The Intangible Value of the Super Utilityman

Finally, I emphasized the often-overlooked "intangible value" of the utility player. **Brendan Donovan** (Cardinals) was my key example. Players who can slot into multiple infield and outfield positions provide irreplaceable flexibility for daily roster management.

When starters are injured, resting, or facing tough matchups, a super utilityman allows you to shuffle your lineup effortlessly to keep your offense running at full capacity. This flexibility isn't just for fixing short-term holes; it's the lubricant that keeps your team performing at a high level throughout the marathon season. When opponents are scrambling to fill empty spots, your lineup remains seamless—a crucial detail for winning your fantasy baseball league.

## Outlook on Sandy Alcantara

We also discussed expectations for **Sandy Alcantara** (Marlins) as he returns from Tommy John surgery next year. My stance is conservative: without any real pitching data, we should treat him with caution. The strategy is to closely monitor his Spring Training, specifically looking for returned velocity and command. Unless he looks dominant in spring, his reasonable draft range should push past the 10th round. At that price, he becomes a sensible, low-risk lottery ticket rather than a core building block.
