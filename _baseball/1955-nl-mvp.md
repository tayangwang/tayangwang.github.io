## 1. Willie Mays (New York Giants, CF)
**Actual Rank:** 4th

**Stats:** .319 BA, .659 SLG, 51 HR, 127 RBI, 9.0 fWAR (8.8 bWAR)

**The Case:** In 1955, Willie Mays was simply playing a different game than everyone else. He blasted 51 home runs to lead the league, while playing his signature electrifying defense in center field. Joe Posnanski writes of Mays' joy and his ability to do the impossible look routine. He was the "Say Hey Kid," captivating fans with his hat flying off as he rounded the bases or chased down fly balls in the vast expanse of the Polo Grounds.

## 2. Duke Snider (Brooklyn Dodgers, CF)
**Actual Rank:** 2nd

**Stats:** .309 BA, 1.046 OPS, 42 HR, 136 RBI, 7.7 fWAR (8.2 bWAR)

**The Case:** "The Duke of Flatbush" had arguably his finest season in 1955. He was the offensive engine of the World Champion Dodgers, leading the league in runs (126) and RBI (136). Snider's sweet left-handed swing took full advantage of Ebbets Field, but he was a force in any park. He finished a heartbreakingly close second to Campanella in the MVP vote.

## 3. Ernie Banks (Chicago Cubs, SS)
**Actual Rank:** 3rd

**Stats:** 44 HR, 117 RBI, 5 Grand Slams, 7.8 fWAR (7.0 bWAR)

**The Case:** "Let's play two!" Ernie Banks redefined the shortstop position in 1955. He smashed 44 home runs, setting a new record for shortstops, and included a record-setting five grand slams. His infectious joy and incredible power made him a fan favorite, even on a mediocre Cubs team. He was a beacon of light at Wrigley Field.

## 4. Eddie Mathews (Milwaukee Braves, 3B)
**Actual Rank:** Not in Top 10

**Stats:** .400 OBP, 165 wRC+, 41 HR, 101 RBI, 7.5 fWAR (7.2 bWAR)

**The Case:** Eddie Mathews continued to mash in 1955, launching 41 home runs to lead the powerful Braves lineup. He and Aaron formed the most dangerous young duo in baseball. Mathews was a brooding, intense competitor who let his bat do the talking. His left-handed swing was tailor-made for power, and he used it to devastating effect.

## 5. Richie Ashburn (Philadelphia Phillies, CF)
**Actual Rank:** Not in Top 10

**Stats:** .338 BA, .449 OBP, 6.1 fWAR (6.4 bWAR)

**The Case:** Richie Ashburn was the antithesis of the 1950s slugger. He didn't hit home runs, but he did everything else perfectly. "Whitey" won the batting title with a .338 average and posted a staggering .449 on-base percentage. He was a pest on the basepaths and a wizard in center field, tracking down fly balls with ease.

## 6. Roy Campanella (Brooklyn Dodgers, C)
**Actual Rank:** 1st (Winner)

**Stats:** 32 HR, 107 RBI, 152 wRC+, 5.7 fWAR (5.5 bWAR)

**The Case:** After an injury-plagued 1954, Roy Campanella roared back in 1955 to claim his third MVP award. He was the heart and soul of the Dodgers, guiding a pitching staff to the World Series and providing massive power from the catcher position.

**Why He Won:** Campanella's victory was driven by narrative and team success. The Dodgers dominated the league, and "Campy" was their field general. His comeback story from a hand injury in '54 resonated with voters. While Snider had better offensive numbers, Campanella's value as a catcher and leader on the pennant-winning team gave him the edge in a very close vote (226 points to Snider's 221).

## 7. Hank Aaron (Milwaukee Braves, RF)
**Actual Rank:** 10th

**Stats:** .314 BA, 27 HR, 106 RBI, 37 2B, 5.9 fWAR (6.7 bWAR)

**The Case:** 1955 was the year the world truly met Hank Aaron. In just his second season, the 21-year-old outfielder blossomed into a superstar. He made his first All-Star team and led the league in doubles (37), showcasing the smooth, powerful swing that would eventually carry him to the home run record. He was quiet, efficient, and deadly at the plate.

## 8. Stan Musial (St. Louis Cardinals, 1B/OF)
**Actual Rank:** 8th

**Stats:** .319 BA, .408 OBP, 33 HR, 108 RBI, 5.8 fWAR (6.1 bWAR)

**The Case:** For Stan "The Man" Musial, 1955 was just another year at the office. By his own lofty standards, it might have seemed like a "down" year, but for anyone else, it would be a career peak. He continued to be the model of consistency, hitting for average and power while playing in every single game. As Bill James notes, Musial's consistency was so blinding that people often took his brilliance for granted.

## 9. Wally Post (Cincinnati Redlegs, RF)
**Actual Rank:** Not in Top 10

**Stats:** 40 HR, 109 RBI, .550 SLG, 5.0 fWAR (5.3 bWAR)

**The Case:** While Kluszewski drew the headlines, Wally Post was the other hammer in the Reds' lineup. A powerful right fielder, Post broke out in 1955 with 40 home runs, forming a devastating power duo with Kluszewski. He was a classic slugger of the era—big swing, big power, and a threat to go deep every time he stepped to the plate.

## 10. Ted Kluszewski (Cincinnati Redlegs, 1B)
**Actual Rank:** 6th

**Stats:** .314 BA, 47 HR, 113 RBI, 40 Ks, 5.0 fWAR (5.4 bWAR)

**The Case:** "Big Klu" was a terrifying presence in the batter's box. Famous for cutting the sleeves off his uniform to accommodate his massive biceps, Kluszewski was more than just a muscle-bound slugger; he was a precision hitter. In an era where power hitters often struck out 100 times a year, Kluszewski struck out just 40 times while hitting 47 home runs. He was the anchor of a heavy-hitting Reds lineup that terrorized pitching staffs across the league.
