The 1957 National League season marked a changing of the guard. The Milwaukee Braves finally broke through to win the pennant and the World Series, ending the New York dominance. While Hank Aaron took home the MVP hardware, our revisit looks at the complete picture of value in this historic season.

## 1. Willie Mays (New York Giants, CF)
**Actual Rank:** 4th

**Stats:** .333/.407/.626, 35 HR, 97 RBI, 38 SB, 20 3B, 173 OPS+, 8.4 fWAR (8.3 bWAR)

**The Case:** In the Giants' final season in New York, Willie Mays put on a show for the ages. He became the first player in NL history to join the 20-20-20 club (doubles, triples, home runs) while also stealing 38 bases. Bill James notes in his *Historical Baseball Abstract* that Mays was just one Win Share behind Aaron (35 to 34) for the best player in the league. His 8.3 fWAR led the league, showcasing his incredible all-around value. Despite the Giants' mediocre finish, Mays was simply the best player on the field.

## 2. Hank Aaron (Milwaukee Braves, RF)
**Actual Rank:** 1st

**Stats:** .322/.378/.600, 44 HR, 132 RBI, 118 R, 166 OPS+, 7.6 fWAR (8.0 bWAR)

**The Case:** This was the year "Hammerin' Hank" truly arrived. At just 23 years old, Aaron led the league in home runs (44) and RBIs (132), powering the Braves to their first World Series title in Milwaukee. Joe Posnanski writes that Aaron's 1957 season was a masterpiece of consistency and power. His 11th inning walk-off home run on September 23rd to clinch the pennant remains one of the most iconic moments in Braves history. While Mays may have had slightly better advanced metrics, Aaron's narrative and production for the champions made him a deserving MVP.

**Why He Won:** Aaron was the best player on the best team, a classic recipe for MVP success. Leading the league in home runs and RBIs for the pennant-winning Braves made him the clear choice for voters. His clutch hitting down the stretch, particularly the pennant-clinching home run, cemented his status as the league's most valuable player, overcoming Musial's batting title and Mays' all-around brilliance.

## 3. Eddie Mathews (Milwaukee Braves, 3B)
**Actual Rank:** 8th

**Stats:** .292/.387/.540, 32 HR, 94 RBI, 109 R, 153 OPS+, 7.3 fWAR (7.4 bWAR)

**The Case:** Often overshadowed by his teammate Aaron, Eddie Mathews was a superstar in his own right. He provided the left-handed thunder in the Braves' lineup, hitting 32 homers and playing stellar defense at third base. Posnanski highlights Mathews' rugged toughness and his crucial role in the Braves' success. His 7.4 fWAR ranked third in the league, proving that he was an essential part of the Milwaukee machine.

## 4. Ernie Banks (Chicago Cubs, SS)
**Actual Rank:** 6th

**Stats:** .285/.345/.596, 43 HR, 102 RBI, 113 R, 148 OPS+, 6.1 fWAR (6.7 bWAR)

**The Case:** "Mr. Cub" continued to redefine the shortstop position. Banks launched 43 home runs, the most ever by a shortstop at the time, and drove in 102 runs. Posnanski notes that Banks was a beacon of joy and excellence on a struggling Cubs team. His power numbers were staggering for a middle infielder, and his 6.7 fWAR reflects his immense value on both sides of the ball.

## 5. Frank Robinson (Cincinnati Redlegs, LF)
**Actual Rank:** 9th

**Stats:** .322/.404/.520, 29 HR, 75 RBI, 97 R, 152 OPS+, 6.6 fWAR (6.9 bWAR)

**The Case:** Following up his Rookie of the Year campaign, Frank Robinson avoided the sophomore slump entirely. He hit .322 with a .404 on-base percentage, establishing himself as one of the league's premier hitters. While the Redlegs couldn't replicate their 1956 success, Robinson's performance was a bright spot. His intensity and all-around game were already evident, traits that would define his legendary career.

## 6. Stan Musial (St. Louis Cardinals, 1B)
**Actual Rank:** 2nd

**Stats:** .351/.422/.612, 29 HR, 102 RBI, 82 R, 179 OPS+, 6.1 fWAR (6.1 bWAR)

**The Case:** At age 36, "Stan the Man" won his seventh and final batting title with a remarkable .351 average. He also led the league in on-base percentage (.422) and slugging (.612). Though his defense at first base wasn't what it once was in the outfield, his bat was still lethal. Musial finished second in the actual MVP voting, a testament to the immense respect he commanded and his enduring greatness.

## 7. Warren Spahn (Milwaukee Braves, LHP)
**Actual Rank:** 5th (Cy Young Winner)

**Stats:** 21-11, 2.69 ERA, 271.0 IP, 111 K, 130 ERA+, 2.7 fWAR (4.7 bWAR)

**The Case:** The ace of the champion Braves, Warren Spahn won the Cy Young Award (which covered both leagues at the time). He won 21 games and posted a 2.69 ERA, leading the league's pitchers in WAR according to some metrics. Posnanski and Jaffe both laud Spahn's intelligence and durability. In 1957, he was the rock of the Milwaukee rotation, guiding them to glory.

## 8. Don Drysdale (Brooklyn Dodgers, RHP)
**Actual Rank:** 19th

**Stats:** 17-9, 2.69 ERA, 221.0 IP, 148 K, 147 ERA+, 5.1 fWAR (5.8 bWAR)

**The Case:** In his first full season as a starter, 20-year-old Don Drysdale showed flashes of the dominance that would make him a Hall of Famer. He posted a 2.69 ERA and struck out 148 batters. Jay Jaffe notes that Drysdale led the NL in WAR at age 20 (by some calculations), signaling the arrival of a new pitching power in Brooklyn. His intimidation factor and raw stuff were already elite.

## 9. Johnny Podres (Brooklyn Dodgers, LHP)
**Actual Rank:** No Votes

**Stats:** 12-9, 2.66 ERA, 196.0 IP, 109 K, 149 ERA+, 4.6 fWAR (5.8 bWAR)

**The Case:** Johnny Podres led the National League with a 2.66 ERA and 6 shutouts. Known for his clutch performances, Podres was the most effective inning-for-inning pitcher in the league. While his win total (12) kept him off the MVP radar in 1957, his run prevention was superior to even Spahn's. He was a key reason the Dodgers remained competitive in their Brooklyn swan song.

## 10. Duke Snider (Brooklyn Dodgers, CF)
**Actual Rank:** 18th

**Stats:** .274/.358/.563, 40 HR, 92 RBI, 91 R, 144 OPS+, 5.2 fWAR (5.0 bWAR)

**The Case:** In his final season in Brooklyn, the "Duke of Flatbush" hit 40 home runs for the fifth consecutive year. Though his batting average dipped, his power remained elite. Jaffe points out Snider's incredible peak from 1953-57, where he was arguably the most consistent power hitter in the league. He gave the Ebbets Field faithful one last summer of tape-measure shots before the move west.
