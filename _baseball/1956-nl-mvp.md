The 1956 National League season was a showcase of power and pitching, with the Brooklyn Dodgers fighting to defend their title against the rising Milwaukee Braves and Cincinnati Redlegs. While Don Newcombe took home the hardware, our revisit looks at the complete picture of value.

## 1. Duke Snider (Brooklyn Dodgers, CF)
**Stats:** .292/.399/.598, 43 HR, 101 RBI, 112 R, 156 OPS+, 7.6 fWAR (7.5 bWAR)

**The Case:** "The Duke of Flatbush" reigned supreme in 1956. Aided by the friendly confines of Ebbets Field, Snider mashed a league-leading 43 home runs, marking his fourth consecutive season with 40+ homers. As Jay Jaffe notes, Snider had a "four-year head start in establishing supremacy among New York’s renowned triumvirate" of centerfielders. While Mantle and Mays would ultimately eclipse him in career value, in the mid-50s, Snider was the most feared slugger in the Senior Circuit. His 156 OPS+ and consistent power production drive him to the top spot in our rankings.

## 2. Willie Mays (New York Giants, CF)
**Stats:** .296/.369/.557, 36 HR, 84 RBI, 40 SB, 146 OPS+, 7.6 fWAR (7.6 bWAR)

**The Case:** The "Say Hey Kid" continued his brilliance, combining power and speed like no other. Joe Posnanski writes that the memory of Willie Mays is like "the first vivid baseball memory you have... an instinct." In 1956, that instinct translated to 36 homers and a league-leading 40 stolen bases. Jaffe points out that Mays's case as the greatest all-around player is supported by advanced stats, with massive value coming from defense and baserunning. Even in a season where the Giants finished 6th, Mays was a beacon of excellence.

## 3. Hank Aaron (Milwaukee Braves, RF)
**Stats:** .328/.365/.558, 26 HR, 92 RBI, 106 R, 151 OPS+, 7.1 fWAR (7.2 bWAR)

**The Case:** At just 22 years old, Hank Aaron captured his first batting title with a .328 average. While he hadn't yet reached his peak power numbers, his all-around game was already elite. Posnanski describes the scene of Aaron breaking the record years later as a "moving picture album of Henry Aaron’s life," but 1956 was one of the early, vibrant pages. He led the league in hits (200) and doubles (34), displaying the remarkable consistency that would become his hallmark.

## 4. Frank Robinson (Cincinnati Redlegs, LF)
**Stats:** .290/.379/.558, 38 HR, 83 RBI, 122 R, 143 OPS+, 6.5 fWAR (6.6 bWAR)

**The Case:** Bursting onto the scene, Frank Robinson tied the rookie record with 38 home runs. Jim Murray famously wrote, "Frank Robinson always went into second like a guy jumping through a skylight with a drawn Luger." That intensity was evident from day one. He led the league with 122 runs scored and was the sparkplug for a Reds team that stayed in the pennant race all season. A unanimous Rookie of the Year, he immediately established himself as a force to be reckoned with.

## 5. Eddie Mathews (Milwaukee Braves, 3B)
**Stats:** .272/.373/.534, 37 HR, 95 RBI, 103 R, 143 OPS+, 6.9 fWAR (5.3 bWAR)

**The Case:** The other half of Milwaukee's dynamic duo, Eddie Mathews continued to mash. With 37 home runs, he provided the left-handed power to complement Aaron. Mathews was a consistent force at the hot corner, and while his average dipped slightly, his on-base skills and power kept his value incredibly high.

## 6. Warren Spahn (Milwaukee Braves, P)
**Stats:** 20-11, 2.78 ERA, 281.1 IP, 128 K, 127 ERA+, 5.6 fWAR (5.6 bWAR)

**The Case:** The ageless lefty won 20 games for the seventh time. Spahn once said, "Hitting is timing. Pitching is destroying the hitter’s timing." He was a master of that craft in 1956, completing 20 games and anchoring the Braves' staff. His durability and consistency were unmatched, keeping Milwaukee in the hunt until the very end.

## 7. Johnny Antonelli (New York Giants, P)
**Stats:** 20-13, 2.86 ERA, 258.2 IP, 145 K, 137 ERA+, 5.4 fWAR (6.0 bWAR)

**The Case:** Antonelli matched Spahn with 20 wins and posted a stellar 2.86 ERA. While the Giants struggled, Antonelli was a bright spot, finishing second in the league in shutouts (5). He was the ace of the staff and one of the premier left-handers in the game.

## 8. Don Newcombe (Brooklyn Dodgers, P)
**Stats:** 27-7, 3.06 ERA, 268.0 IP, 139 K, 131 ERA+, 4.8 fWAR (5.8 bWAR)

**The Case:** The actual MVP and Cy Young winner, "Newk" had a magical season with 27 wins. He was the workhorse for the pennant-winning Dodgers. While modern metrics might favor others slightly due to strikeouts and defense-independent pitching, there's no denying Newcombe's dominance and his role as the "ultimate stopper" for the champions.

## 9. Ken Boyer (St. Louis Cardinals, 3B)
**Stats:** .306/.360/.505, 26 HR, 98 RBI, 91 R, 128 OPS+, 5.6 fWAR (6.2 bWAR)

**The Case:** An underrated star, Boyer put together a fantastic season at third base. He hit over .300 with power and played Gold Glove-caliber defense (before the award existed). He was a cornerstone for the Cardinals and one of the best all-around third basemen of his era.

## 10. Jim Gilliam (Brooklyn Dodgers, 2B)
**Stats:** .300/.399/.406, 6 HR, 43 RBI, 102 R, 21 SB, 116 OPS+, 4.9 fWAR (5.6 bWAR)

**The Case:** The unsung hero of the Dodgers, "Junior" Gilliam did it all. He got on base (.399 OBP), scored over 100 runs, and played versatile defense. He was the perfect table-setter for the big bats of Snider, Hodges, and Campanella, providing the spark that ignited the Brooklyn offense.
