The 1959 National League season was a thriller, culminating in a tie-breaker series between the Dodgers and the Braves, with Los Angeles eventually triumphing and going on to win the World Series. In the MVP race, Ernie Banks made history by becoming the first National League player to win back-to-back MVP awards, despite playing for a Cubs team that finished well out of contention. But was he truly the most valuable player in the league, or did the "Say Hey Kid" and "Hammerin' Hank" have better cases?

Here is the re-ranked top 10 for the 1959 NL MVP:

### 1. Ernie Banks (Chicago Cubs, SS)
**Actual Rank:** 1st

**Stats:** .304/.374/.596, 45 HR, 143 RBI, 102 R, 2 SB, 9.7 fWAR (10.2 bWAR)

**The Case:** Ernie Banks followed up his historic 1958 campaign with an even better season in 1959. He led the majors with 143 RBIs and smashed 45 home runs, all while playing a solid shortstop. His 10.2 bWAR is a staggering figure, and he led the league with a 9.7 fWAR. Banks was a one-man wrecking crew for the Cubs. As Bill James notes, "Banks was a fine player... I think he was one of the top 100 players of all time." In 1959, he was at the absolute peak of his powers, providing elite offense from a premium defensive position. The fact that he won the MVP on a 5th-place team speaks volumes about his individual dominance.

**Why He Won:** Voters love RBIs, and 143 of them is a number that demands attention. Combined with 45 homers and his reputation as the game's best shortstop, Banks was an easy choice. He was the most feared hitter in the league and the face of the Cubs franchise.

### 2. Hank Aaron (Milwaukee Braves, RF)
**Actual Rank:** 3rd

**Stats:** .355/.401/.636, 39 HR, 123 RBI, 116 R, 8 SB, 8.2 fWAR (8.7 bWAR)

**The Case:** Hank Aaron had arguably his finest offensive season in 1959, leading the league in batting average (.355), slugging percentage (.636), hits (223), and total bases (400). He was a hitting machine, spraying line drives all over the field and crushing 39 homers to boot. Aaron was the centerpiece of a Braves offense that nearly won its third straight pennant. His consistency was legendary; as Joe Posnanski writes, Aaron was "so consistent and great that people sometimes took him for granted." In 1959, he was simply unstoppable.

### 3. Eddie Mathews (Milwaukee Braves, 3B)
**Actual Rank:** 2nd

**Stats:** .306/.390/.593, 46 HR, 114 RBI, 118 R, 6 SB, 8.3 fWAR (8.2 bWAR)

**The Case:** Eddie Mathews led the league with 46 home runs in 1959, forming the most devastating 1-2 punch in baseball with Hank Aaron. He finished second in the actual MVP voting, a testament to his immense power and all-around game. Mathews was a fierce competitor and a brilliant third baseman. He drew 93 walks and scored 118 runs, constantly setting the table or clearing it. It was a bounce-back year for Mathews after a "down" 1958, reminding everyone why he was on a Hall of Fame trajectory.

### 4. Willie Mays (San Francisco Giants, CF)
**Actual Rank:** 6th

**Stats:** .313/.382/.583, 34 HR, 104 RBI, 121 R, 27 SB, 7.4 fWAR (7.8 bWAR)

**The Case:** While Willie Mays didn't lead the league in WAR in 1959, he still posted a spectacular season with a 7.4 fWAR and 7.8 bWAR. He did it all: hitting for average and power, stealing 27 bases, and playing peerless defense in center field. He finished a distant 6th in the actual voting, likely due to "voter fatigue" and the Giants' late-season fade. Mays was the most complete player in the game, a dynamo who could beat you in a dozen different ways. His combination of speed and power was unmatched, even if his metrics were slightly down from his 1958 peak.

### 5. Ken Boyer (St. Louis Cardinals, 3B)
**Actual Rank:** 10th

**Stats:** .309/.374/.526, 28 HR, 94 RBI, 90 R, 4 SB, 5.9 fWAR (7.4 bWAR)

**The Case:** Ken Boyer continued to establish himself as the premier third baseman in the National League (alongside Mathews), winning another Gold Glove and hitting over .300 with nearly 30 homers. He was the rock of the Cardinals' lineup and defense. Boyer was a quiet leader who let his play do the talking. His 8.0 bWAR shows just how valuable his all-around contributions were. He was a steady, reliable star in an era of giants.

### 6. Frank Robinson (Cincinnati Reds, OF/1B)
**Actual Rank:** 9th

**Stats:** .311/.376/.562, 36 HR, 125 RBI, 106 R, 11 SB, 5.5 fWAR (5.8 bWAR)

**The Case:** Frank Robinson was a run-producing machine for the Reds, driving in 125 runs and hitting 36 homers. He was one of the most feared competitors in the game, playing with an intensity that bordered on ferocity. Robinson was a true five-tool threat who could beat you with his bat, his legs, or his arm. In 1959, he was the heart and soul of the Cincinnati offense, cementing his status as one of the game's elite young sluggers.

### 7. Sam Jones (San Francisco Giants, P)
**Actual Rank:** 5th

**Stats:** 21-15, 2.83 ERA, 270.2 IP, 225 SO, 5.1 fWAR (5.2 bWAR)

**The Case:** "Toothpick Sam" Jones had a career year in 1959, leading the league in ERA (2.83) and strikeouts (225). He was named the NL Pitcher of the Year by *The Sporting News*. Jones was dominant, using his devastating curveball to baffle hitters all season. He won 21 games for a Giants team that was in the race until the very end. It was the finest season of his career, a year where he put it all together and was arguably the best pitcher in the league.

### 8. Vern Law (Pittsburgh Pirates, P)
**Actual Rank:** 15th

**Stats:** 18-9, 2.98 ERA, 265.2 IP, 114 SO, 3.9 fWAR (6.6 bWAR)

**The Case:** Vern Law, known as "The Deacon," was the ace of a rising Pirates team. He won 18 games with a stellar 2.98 ERA and showed incredible control. Law wasn't a big strikeout pitcher, but he induced weak contact and ate up innings (20 complete games). His 1959 season was a precursor to his Cy Young campaign in 1960, showing that he was ready to lead the Pirates to glory.

### 9. Johnny Antonelli (San Francisco Giants, P)
**Actual Rank:** 8th

**Stats:** 19-10, 3.10 ERA, 241.0 IP, 117 SO, 4.1 fWAR (4.9 bWAR)

**The Case:** Johnny Antonelli was the lefty complement to Sam Jones in the Giants' rotation, winning 19 games and making his fifth All-Star team. He was a workhorse who kept the Giants in contention. While his strikeout numbers weren't overwhelming, he knew how to pitch and how to win. Antonelli was a key part of the Giants' resurgence in San Francisco.

### 10. Warren Spahn (Milwaukee Braves, P)
**Actual Rank:** 7th

**Stats:** 21-15, 2.96 ERA, 292.0 IP, 143 SO, 4.4 fWAR (6.2 bWAR)

**The Case:** Another year, another 20-win season for the great Warren Spahn. He led the league in complete games (21), shutouts (4), and innings pitched (292.0). At age 38, he was still the workhorse of the Braves' staff. Spahn's durability and consistency were marvels of the modern game. He was the rock that the Braves leaned on, year after year.
