The 1958 National League MVP race was a showdown between two of the game's most iconic figures: Ernie Banks, who was redefining the shortstop position with his power, and Willie Mays, who was simply redefining what was possible on a baseball field. While Banks took home the hardware with a historic season, a closer look at the numbers suggests the "Say Hey Kid" might have had the edge in overall value.

Here is the re-ranked top 10 for the 1958 NL MVP:

### 1. Willie Mays (San Francisco Giants, CF)
**Actual Rank:** 2nd

**Stats:** .347/.419/.583, 29 HR, 96 RBI, 121 R, 31 SB, 9.7 fWAR (10.2 bWAR)

**The Case:** Willie Mays in 1958 was a force of nature. He posted a staggering 9.7 fWAR, the best in the league, and won his second consecutive Gold Glove. He hit for a high average (.347), showed immense power (29 HR), and terrorized opponents on the basepaths (31 SB). It was a season that showcased his "five-tool" genius in every possible way. Mays was the engine of the Giants' offense and defense. As Joe Posnanski writes, "The greatest player of all time is Willie Mays." In 1958, he was at the peak of his powers, doing things in center field that no one had ever seen before. His combination of speed, power, and defense was unmatched, and while Banks had the gaudier home run totals, Mays was the more complete player.

### 2. Ernie Banks (Chicago Cubs, SS)
**Actual Rank:** 1st

**Stats:** .313/.366/.614, 47 HR, 129 RBI, 119 R, 8.7 fWAR (9.3 bWAR)

**The Case:** Ernie Banks had a season for the ages, hitting 47 home runs—a record for shortstops at the time—and driving in a league-leading 129 runs. He posted an 8.7 fWAR, a phenomenal number that would be worthy of MVP honors in almost any other year. His power production from a premium defensive position was revolutionary. "Let's play two!" Banks' infectious joy and love for the game were matched only by his incredible bat. He was the first shortstop to truly be a feared slugger, and 1958 was his masterpiece.

**Why He Won:** Banks' power numbers were simply impossible to ignore. Hitting 47 home runs as a shortstop was unheard of, and leading the league in RBIs while playing for a 5th-place team showed just how dominant he was. The voters rightfully recognized a historic individual performance that transcended his team's standings.

### 3. Hank Aaron (Milwaukee Braves, RF)
**Actual Rank:** 3rd

**Stats:** .326/.386/.546, 30 HR, 95 RBI, 109 R, 6.8 fWAR (7.3 bWAR)

**The Case:** The reigning MVP didn't slow down in 1958. Aaron hit .326 with 30 homers and 95 RBIs, providing the steady, elite production that defined his career. He also won his first Gold Glove, proving he was more than just a bat. His 6.8 fWAR solidified his status as one of the game's elite. Hank Aaron was a "dazzler," as Posnanski describes—so consistent and great that people sometimes took him for granted. He wasn't flashy, but he was perfect. In 1958, he helped lead the Braves to another pennant with his quiet, relentless excellence.

### 4. Richie Ashburn (Philadelphia Phillies, CF)
**Actual Rank:** 7th

**Stats:** .350/.440/.441, 2 HR, 33 RBI, 215 H, 97 BB, 6.5 fWAR (7.0 bWAR)

**The Case:** Richie Ashburn was an on-base machine in 1958, winning the batting title with a .350 average and leading the league with a .440 OBP and 215 hits. He also drew a league-high 97 walks. While he lacked power, his ability to get on base and play elite defense in center field made him incredibly valuable. "Whitey" was the consummate leadoff man and a defensive wizard. Jay Jaffe notes that Ashburn was an outstanding table-setter who covered plenty of ground. 1958 was arguably his finest season, a year where his pure hitting ability was on full display.

### 5. Sam Jones (St. Louis Cardinals, RHP)
**Actual Rank:** 20th

**Stats:** 14-13, 2.88 ERA, 250.0 IP, 225 SO, 5.5 fWAR (6.3 bWAR)

**The Case:** "Toothpick Sam" was the most dominant strikeout pitcher in the league, fanning 225 batters to lead the NL. He also had a stellar 2.88 ERA. While his 14-13 record wasn't eye-popping, his ability to miss bats was unrivaled. Jones was a terrifying presence on the mound, known for his wicked curveball—which Stan Musial called the best he ever saw—and his occasional wildness (he also led the league in walks). In 1958, he harnessed that stuff to become a true ace.

### 6. Lew Burdette (Milwaukee Braves, RHP)
**Actual Rank:** 11th

**Stats:** 20-10, 2.91 ERA, 275.1 IP, 113 SO, 5.0 fWAR (3.4 bWAR)

**The Case:** Fresh off his World Series heroics, Burdette won 20 games in 1958 with a 2.91 ERA. He was a workhorse for the pennant-winning Braves, tossing 19 complete games. His control and durability were key to Milwaukee's success. Burdette was a fidgety, chatty competitor who used every trick in the book (including the threat of a spitball) to get hitters out. He was the perfect complement to Warren Spahn, giving the Braves a devastating 1-2 punch.

### 7. Eddie Mathews (Milwaukee Braves, 3B)
**Actual Rank:** 18th

**Stats:** .251/.359/.460, 25 HR, 68 RBI, 77 BB, 5.8 fWAR (6.5 bWAR)

**The Case:** It was a "down" year for Mathews by his lofty standards, hitting just .251. However, he still mashed 25 homers and drew 77 walks, maintaining a strong OBP. His defense remained excellent, contributing to a solid 6.5 bWAR. Mathews was the thunder to Aaron's lightning. Even in a year where his average dipped, his power presence in the lineup was terrifying for opposing pitchers. He remained a key leader on the league's best team.

### 8. Ken Boyer (St. Louis Cardinals, 3B)
**Actual Rank:** 14th

**Stats:** .307/.376/.490, 23 HR, 90 RBI, 101 R, 5.3 fWAR (6.0 bWAR)

**The Case:** Ken Boyer put together a fantastic all-around season, hitting .307 with 23 homers and 90 RBIs. He also won his first Gold Glove at third base. He was a consistent force in the middle of the Cardinals' lineup and a vacuum cleaner at the hot corner. Boyer was the "complete player"—he could hit, run, and field with the best of them. 1958 marked his ascent as the premier third baseman in the league, a mantle he would hold for years.

### 9. Warren Spahn (Milwaukee Braves, LHP)
**Actual Rank:** 5th

**Stats:** 22-11, 3.07 ERA, 290.0 IP, 150 SO, 3.6 fWAR (4.6 bWAR)

**The Case:** The ageless wonder did it again, winning 22 games to lead the league. He threw 290 innings and completed 23 games. At age 37, he was still one of the best pitchers in baseball. "Spahn and Sain and two days of rain" was a distant memory, but Spahn was still dominating. He had begun to master the screwball (or circle change), reinventing himself to stay ahead of hitters. He was the ace of the staff and the heart of the Braves.

### 10. Stan Musial (St. Louis Cardinals, 1B/OF)
**Actual Rank:** 12th

**Stats:** .337/.408/.512, 17 HR, 62 RBI, 35 2B, 4.0 fWAR (4.5 bWAR)

**The Case:** Stan the Man kept rolling in 1958, hitting .337 and banging out 35 doubles. While his power was starting to fade slightly, he was still one of the toughest outs in the game. 1958 was a milestone year for Musial, as he collected his 3,000th career hit with a pinch-hit double in Chicago. He remained the gold standard for hitting excellence and sportsmanship, a beloved figure who could still punish pitching at an elite level.
